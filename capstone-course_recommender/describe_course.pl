It plays such a crucial role that there are people called Database Administrators that specialize in just organizing the data. The traditional database used to be, and often still is, a relational database. MySQL is one of the most popular relational databases and is backed by the Oracle corporation as well. This provides the developer with a variety of online resources. The popularity of MySQL combined with the popularity of Python has resulted in the development of an API that makes the interface between Python and MySQL almost seamless. In this course, you will create a Python application using Pythonï¿½s MySQL Connector that creates a MySQL database containing words and their definitions. You will then retrieve words and definitions from the database table, update a definition in the database table, and display a selected wordï¿½s definition.

In particular, this MOOC covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app (such as Java’s various looping constructs and conditional statements), enable access to structured data (such as Javas built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap), group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Javas primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps. Learners will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments.'), nl,

In this course, you will learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real-world data. You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real-world problems. In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, we will examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future. The backbone project in this course will be a route planning application. You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.
